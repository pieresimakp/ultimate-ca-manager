Migration 020: Fix AcmeClientOrder.expires_at for issued orders (issue #74)

Background
----------
RFC 8555 §7.1.3 says the ACME order resource's ``expires`` field is the
expiry of the *order resource itself*, NOT the issued certificate's
``notAfter``. Let's Encrypt sets this to ~7 days.

Prior to v2.128, ``acme_client_service.finalize_order`` left
``order.expires_at`` at that 7-day value even after the certificate was
issued. ``acme_renewal_service.scheduled_acme_renewal`` then compares
``expires_at <= now + 30 days`` and concludes the cert needs renewal —
forever. This causes a renewal storm and trips the LE production rate
limits (`see issue #74 <https://github.com/NeySlim/ultimate-ca-manager/issues/74>`_).

This migration backfills ``expires_at`` on every issued order to the
linked certificate's actual ``not_after`` so the renewal scheduler stops
re-issuing them.

Multi-backend convention (v2.128+)
----------------------------------
This is the first migration that runs on **both** SQLite and PostgreSQL.
It declares ``pg_compatible = True`` so the runner invokes it on PG, and
exposes an ``upgrade(arg)`` that accepts either:
  * ``sqlite3.Connection`` — when running against SQLite (legacy path)
  * ``sqlalchemy.Engine``   — when running against PostgreSQL

Migrations 000-019 are SQLite-only by design (they predate PG support);
the runner silently marks them applied on PG installs because fresh PG
installs use ``SQLAlchemy.create_all()`` and don't need the historical
schema deltas.
