## Certificate Management

### Creating a Certificate

1. Go to **Certificates** page
2. Click **+ New Certificate** button
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Common Name** - Primary identifier (e.g., `www.example.com`)
   - **Subject Alternative Names** - Additional domains/IPs
   - **Issuing CA** - Select parent CA
   - **Template** - Use preset or custom settings
   - **Validity** - Certificate lifetime
4. Click **Create**

### Exporting Certificates

1. Select a certificate in the table
2. In the details panel, click **Export**
3. Choose format:
   - **PEM** - Standard format (certificate + key)
   - **PKCS12** - Windows/Java compatible bundle
   - **DER** - Binary format
4. Set password (for PKCS12)
5. Download or copy to clipboard

### Revoking Certificates

1. Select the certificate
2. Click **Revoke** in details panel
3. Select revocation reason
4. Confirm action
5. Certificate is added to CRL automatically

---

## CA Management

### Creating a Root CA

1. Go to **Certificate Authorities** page
2. Click **+ New CA**
3. Select **Root CA** type
4. Configure:
   - **Common Name** - CA identifier
   - **Organization** - Your organization name
   - **Key Type** - RSA 4096 or ECDSA P-384 recommended
   - **Validity** - 10-20 years typical for Root
5. Click **Create**

### Creating an Intermediate CA

1. Go to **Certificate Authorities** page
2. Click **+ New CA**
3. Select **Intermediate CA** type
4. Choose **Parent CA** from your Root CAs
5. Configure settings (5-10 year validity typical)
6. Click **Create**

### CA Hierarchy View

- Toggle between **Grid** and **Tree** view using the view switcher
- Tree view shows parent-child relationships
- Click any CA to see its details and issued certificates

### Taking a CA Offline

Offline mode prevents a CA from signing anything (CSRs, certificates, intermediate CAs, new CRLs). Useful for Root CAs that should only be brought online during planned signing events.

1. Open the CA detail panel
2. Click **Take Offline**
3. Confirm, then enter and confirm an **offline password** (12+ chars, mixed case, digit, symbol — same policy as user passwords)
4. Choose a mode:
   - **Keep in UCM** — key stays in the database, re-wrapped under your password (plus the master key on top). Restore = enter password.
   - **Download file** — key is exported as a password-encrypted PKCS#8 PEM and **deleted from UCM**. Restore = re-upload file + password. The downloaded file is the only copy — store it safely.

The CA list shows an **Offline** badge while offline. Existing CRLs continue to be served via CDP; new CRLs cannot be signed until restore.

### Restoring an Offline CA

1. Open the offline CA's detail panel
2. Click **Restore**
3. Enter the offline password
4. If the CA was exported to file, also select the previously downloaded `.key.pem` file
5. The CA returns to its previous status and resumes signing

⚠️ Lose the password (or the file in file-exported mode) and the CA is unrecoverable — there is no master override.

## CSR Management

### Signing a CSR

1. Go to **CSRs** page
2. Upload CSR file or paste PEM content
3. Select in the list
4. Click **Sign**
5. Choose:
   - **Issuing CA** - Which CA will sign
   - **Template** - Certificate profile
   - **Validity** - Override template default
6. Click **Sign CSR**
7. Download or copy the signed certificate

---

## Templates

   - **Extended Key Usage** - Server Auth, Client Auth, etc.
   - **Default Validity** - Days/months/years
